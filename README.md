## Fast Mask Fades and Single Picture Sprite Creation\!

### Description

This little ap is a powerful addition to anyone's

library of code. It produces fast fades and fade effects

using an unusual "masking" technique. It will also take

your "single" fade in picture and produce the two required

for sprite transparency! It does this by converting the

background color to the two mask colors needed in

sprite transparency. This assuming the background

is of a solid color of course. This will save alot of

time not having to edit two pictures.

As for the masking technique used in the fades a tiny

20 x 20 pixel black and white mask is used. This tiny mask

is expanded by the ap and passed over the sprite in a

user entered X, Y scanning fashion. The sprite will bleed thru

the white portions of the mask as it is being scanned, unto

the main picture. And maintain sprite transparency!

I have tried to make the ap as easy to use and as

self explanatory as possible.

To get an idea of the program's function you might try to

use the default pictures and scan values for

the masks. To change masks or pictures simply click on the

appropiate box. Changing masks will change the default

scan values for you. After you get the hang of it you may

want to try making your own masks with Window's Paint.

I have included 14 masks in this zip along with a few pictures.

If you are into graphics, fades, etc, you will want to

check this out!

Have fun!

PS: I tried to include a sceenshot but

PSC don't seem to take it.
